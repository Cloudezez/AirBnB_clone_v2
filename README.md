## Project Overview
This project involves deploying static files from the AirBnB Clone project using Fabric, a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.

## Concepts
The following concepts are covered in this project:
- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment to automate the software release process.
- **AirBnB Clone:** A simplified version of the AirBnB website, focused on deploying static files.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Explain what Fabric is and how to use it for code deployment.
2. Deploy code to a server easily.
3. Create a `tgz` archive.
4. Execute Fabric commands both locally and remotely.
5. Transfer files using Fabric.
6. Manage Nginx configuration, including understanding the difference between `root` and `alias`.

## Project Tasks
1. **Prepare your web servers:**
   - Install Nginx and set up your web servers for deployment.
   - Create necessary directories and set appropriate permissions.

2. **Compress before sending:**
   - Write a Fabric script that generates a `.tgz` archive from the `web_static` fo
